Post Prompts
============

Pull the Daily Prompt from [The Daily Post](http://dailypost.wordpress.com/) on WordPress.com.

This plugin adds a widget to your dashboard, displaying the prompt and a button to use it. Once you click, the prompt will be pre-filled into the post content & title. You can edit these as you wish, just make sure to leave the link&mdash; The Daily Post will use the pingback to show your post on its page.
